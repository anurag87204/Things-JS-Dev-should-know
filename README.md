# 🍌 Things JavaScript Developers Should Know, but Probably Don't

This is a special spot I've created where I'm unpacking essential things about JavaScript. It's mainly a personal project for me to get a better grip on the ins and outs of JavaScript, but I figured it might be useful for others too.
